# Pathfinder Visualizer: Making Algorithms Visible

Understanding pathfinding algorithms through textbook descriptions alone can be abstract and difficult. I wanted to create an interactive tool that makes BFS and DFS tangible and accessible for learners.

## The Problem with Learning Algorithms

Pathfinding algorithms are fundamental to computer science, but they're typically taught through:

- Static diagrams that don't show progression
- Pseudocode that's hard to map to real behavior
- Examples too simple to reveal nuances

I wanted to bridge this gap with an interactive tool that lets users experiment and learn through play.

## Building for Understanding

The visualizer uses a 20x20 grid where users can draw walls, set start and end points, and watch algorithms find paths in real-time. Color-coded cells show visited nodes, the current frontier, and the final path.

### The Animation Challenge

The biggest technical hurdle was rendering hundreds of state changes smoothly. My initial implementation updated the UI immediately after each algorithm step, which caused severe jank on slower devices.

The solution was a render queue that batches updates and uses `requestAnimationFrame` to synchronize with the browser's refresh rate. This achieved consistent 60fps animations while keeping the algorithm logic clean and separate from the rendering logic.

### Design for Learning

Color choices weren't arbitrary - I researched data visualization best practices to ensure high contrast and accessibility. The palette makes it easy to distinguish between:

- Unexplored cells (white)
- Frontier cells being considered (light blue)
- Visited cells already explored (darker blue)
- The final path (yellow)

## Side-by-Side Comparison

The comparison mode lets users run BFS and DFS simultaneously on the same maze. This visual comparison makes the algorithms' differences immediately obvious:

- BFS explores level-by-level (finds shortest path)
- DFS dives deep before backtracking (may not find shortest path)

Seeing this play out in real-time is far more intuitive than reading about it.
