# Cleveland GiveCamp: Building for Good

Cleveland GiveCamp's existing website didn't effectively showcase their 15-year legacy of connecting tech professionals with nonprofits. With an outdated design and limited content management capabilities, they needed a modern platform that would inspire volunteers and nonprofits alike while being maintainable by non-technical staff.

## The Mission

Cleveland GiveCamp brings together developers, designers, and project managers for a 48-hour hackathon to build technology solutions for local nonprofits—completely free of charge. Over 15 years, they've helped 250+ nonprofits and contributed over $7.2 million in value to the community.

## Our Approach

Working with a team of six volunteers, we redesigned and rebuilt their entire web presence over a single weekend. We chose Squarespace as our foundation to balance rapid development with long-term maintainability, then enhanced it with custom HTML/CSS components for unique features like the sponsor carousel.

The result is a modern, mobile-responsive website that effectively communicates their mission, celebrates their impact, and makes it easy for both volunteers and nonprofits to get involved.
