challenges: [
{
title: 'GitHub API Rate Limiting',
description: 'GitHub\'s REST API has strict rate limits (5,000 requests/hour). Fetching data for users with hundreds of repositories and analyzing language statistics would quickly exhaust the limit.',
solution: 'Implemented an in-memory caching strategy with 5-minute TTL that reduces API calls by 80% for returning users. Added batch processing for repository language analysis and a rate limit monitoring endpoint that displays current usage.',

description: 'Rendering contribution heatmaps (365 data points) and complex charts caused performance issues on mobile devices, particularly during animations.',

},
{
title: 'OAuth Flow Complexity',
description: 'Managing OAuth flows across development and production environments while handling edge cases (denied permissions, network errors, invalid tokens) was complex and error-prone.',

learnings: [
'Rate limiting isn\'t just about hitting limits - proactive caching improves UX even when under limits',
'NextAuth.js is worth the learning curve - OAuth is complex and easy to get wrong',
'Progressive loading and skeletons matter more than raw speed for perceived performance',
'Server Components in Next.js 15 significantly reduce client-side JavaScript and improve initial load',

# GitHub Profile Analyzer: Making Code Stories Visual

GitHub's native analytics provide basic statistics, but developers lack a comprehensive way to understand their coding patterns, language preferences, and contribution trends. I wanted to create a tool that transforms GitHub data into beautiful, shareable insights.

## The Vision

As developers, our GitHub profiles tell a story - but that story is scattered across dozens of repositories, thousands of commits, and years of contributions. This project aggregates that data into a cohesive narrative with intuitive visualizations.

## Technical Architecture

Built on Next.js 15 with the GitHub REST API, the application uses OAuth for secure authentication and implements a sophisticated caching layer to work within GitHub's rate limits. The frontend leverages Recharts for performant data visualization and Framer Motion for smooth animations.

### Key Technical Decisions

**NextAuth.js for OAuth**: Rather than implementing OAuth flows manually, I chose NextAuth.js to handle the complexity of token management, session storage, and refresh logic.

**In-Memory Caching**: A 5-minute TTL cache dramatically reduces API calls for returning users while keeping data fresh enough for meaningful updates.

**Server Components**: Next.js 15's Server Components handle initial data fetching, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving time-to-interactive.

## The Year in Review Feature

The standout feature is an interactive "Year in Review" that presents a developer's statistics in a story-style format with keyboard navigation. It aggregates commits, languages, repositories, and contributions into a shareable celebration of their work.
