# GitHub Profile Analyzer: Making Code Stories Visual

GitHub's native analytics provide basic statistics, but developers lack a comprehensive way to understand their coding patterns, language preferences, and contribution trends. I wanted to create a tool that transforms GitHub data into beautiful, shareable insights.

## The Vision

As developers, our GitHub profiles tell a story - but that story is scattered across dozens of repositories, thousands of commits, and years of contributions. This project aggregates that data into a cohesive narrative with intuitive visualizations.

## Technical Architecture

Built on Next.js 15 with the GitHub REST API, the application uses OAuth for secure authentication and implements a sophisticated caching layer to work within GitHub's rate limits. The frontend leverages Recharts for performant data visualization and Framer Motion for smooth animations.

### Key Technical Decisions

**NextAuth.js for OAuth**: Rather than implementing OAuth flows manually, I chose NextAuth.js to handle the complexity of token management, session storage, and refresh logic.

**In-Memory Caching**: A 5-minute TTL cache dramatically reduces API calls for returning users while keeping data fresh enough for meaningful updates.

**Server Components**: Next.js 15's Server Components handle initial data fetching, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving time-to-interactive.

## The Year in Review Feature

The standout feature is an interactive "Year in Review" that presents a developer's statistics in a story-style format with keyboard navigation. It aggregates commits, languages, repositories, and contributions into a shareable celebration of their work.
