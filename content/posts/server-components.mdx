# The Power of Server Components in Next.js

React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. Next.js has embraced this technology, making it easier than ever to build performant web applications.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are a new kind of React component that runs only on the server. They can access server-side resources directly, like databases or file systems, without adding to the JavaScript bundle sent to the client.

## Benefits of Server Components

- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Server Components don't send their code to the client, resulting in smaller JavaScript bundles.
- **Direct Access to Backend Resources**: No need for API routes for data fetching.
- **Improved Performance**: Initial page load is faster due to reduced client-side JavaScript.
- **Better SEO**: Content is rendered on the server, making it more accessible to search engines.

## Using Server Components in Next.js

In Next.js App Router, all components are Server Components by default. You only need to use the "use client" directive when you need client-side interactivity.

## Conclusion

Server Components in Next.js provide a powerful way to build performant web applications with improved user experience and developer workflow.
