# A Weekend of Service: My Experience at Cleveland GiveCamp

Cleveland GiveCamp brings together developers, designers, and volunteers to build software solutions for nonprofit organizations — all in a single weekend. This year, the event supported 10 different nonprofit organizations, including GiveCamp itself.

## History of Cleveland GiveCamp

Now in its 15th year, 2025 marked the first time Cleveland GiveCamp was officially recognized as a nonprofit by the IRS. Over the past decade and a half, they’ve helped more than 250 nonprofits, engaged over 1,000 volunteers, and contributed over $7.2 million in value.

## Why I Joined

As someone new to the field of software development, this was my first opportunity to contribute to a real-world project outside of an academic setting. I got to work side-by-side with developers, project managers, and designers — and learn from all of them.

Being able to work with professional developers helped my confidence. I don’t subscribe to the idea of _imposter syndrome_, but I have felt that I might not be ready to be a working developer. This opportunity gave me the space to find out if I was truly ready to be a paid developer in the “wild.”

Beyond professional growth, this event spoke to something deeper. Service is core to who I am. Being able to apply the knowledge I’ve gained to help organizations whose entire mission is to uplift others — especially those society too often overlooks — was truly fulfilling.

## The Project

Our team was paired with the nonprofit **Cleveland GiveCamp Inc.**, whose mission is to connect tech professionals with nonprofits that need software solutions. Their request was straightforward but impactful:

> **Redesign their outdated website to better reflect their mission and community impact.**

### My Role

I contributed as both a developer and a designer. My responsibilities included:

- Designed and built the **Events** section
- Assisted with the overall layout and visual design
- Developed a scrolling tag of sponsor logos to showcase community partners

#### Tools & Technologies

- **Squarespace** – Chosen so the organization can easily update content without developer assistance
- **HTML/CSS** – Used to create the smooth scrolling sponsor section
- **Taiga (Kanban)** – Project management tool to organize our tasks and sprints

## The Weekend Workflow

GiveCamp is fast-paced — you have just 48 hours to deliver a working solution. Here’s how our weekend unfolded:

1. **Friday**: Meet the nonprofit, understand the project scope, begin initial planning
2. **Saturday**: Full day of design and development — powered by caffeine and collaboration
3. **Sunday**: Polish, debug, present the final product, and hand off documentation

The best part? Everyone was there for the same reason: to help. You’re surrounded by people who bring positive energy, problem-solving skills, and a deep sense of purpose.

## Lessons Learned

- **Constraints fuel creativity.** With limited time, we had to prioritize and make smart decisions fast.
- **Mission matters.** Hearing directly from the nonprofit grounded our work in real impact.
- **Community is powerful.** Watching strangers become a high-performing team in a weekend was incredible.

## Takeaways

Cleveland GiveCamp reminded me that software isn’t just about clean code or elegant UI — it’s about people, purpose, and meaningful outcomes.

Changing careers often comes with practical goals — better pay, better hours, and a fresh challenge. But GiveCamp showed me something deeper: the skills I’ve gained can have a direct, positive impact on people’s lives. In a world connected by the internet, where data is the new currency, this experience reminded me that technology can be a force for good.
