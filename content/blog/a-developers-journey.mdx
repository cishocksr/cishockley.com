# A Developer’s Journey

Welcome to the journey of my life in technology. Some may say it’s been too long for a dream—that it’s nothing more than that. But technology has been part of my life since third grade, when I was lucky to learn in the **Math & Science Center** in the basement of the East Cleveland Public Library in East Cleveland, OH.

There, we used Apple II computers—my first real glimpse of computing. I didn’t know it then, but the curiosity that started in that basement would trail me for years, waiting for me to notice.

When my family finally had a home computer, I wanted to write scripts and build things. Then life kept moving, and I started to believe this was something I could never truly achieve. It became a childhood dream I quietly tucked away.

---

Fast-forward to adulthood: I joined the **U.S. Navy**. While serving, I went deeper—binary concepts, advanced networking, the foundations behind the screens. But, as before, _life was lifing_, and a path into tech still didn’t feel clear.

---

During the pandemic I picked up JavaScript. I began to understand programming fundamentals and realized I’d been standing behind my own barrier to entry. Then I found community at **Lambda School**, where I learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and some backend with Node.js.

I thought it would lead straight to a tech job. It didn’t—but that wasn’t on the program. Many in my cohort (and alumni before us) landed great roles and are doing amazing work.

---

My story was different. Maybe because I was a single dad focused on providing. Maybe because I didn’t yet believe I belonged. Either way, I kept my day job and kept honing my skills—telling myself I’d keep going _until I got better_.

---

I went to work at **Amazon**, moved into leadership, and the money was good. But the stability became an anchor—steady and heavy—keeping me in a familiar, comfortable place when I knew there was more to explore.

The itch never stopped tugging. Through Amazon, I was accepted into a **Java Developer Bootcamp** run by **Tech Elevator**. We revisited HTML/CSS and went deep into **Java**, a backbone language for backend systems.

It was tough: I worked 45–60 hours a week, then sat through a five-hour class after a 12-hour shift. But I showed up. I learned. I grew.

---

Now I’m putting myself out there. I built this portfolio and a blog I’ll update at least twice a month—not just to show my technical growth, but my growth as a person.

So, welcome. Browse the projects, read the posts, and leave a note in the guestbook. This site is here to showcase my work, yes—but more than that, it’s here to show the **power of perseverance**.

Today, I’m not yet a working developer… but I will be soon. And that third-grader who once played on those Apple II computers will get to see where his curiosity led.

If you’re standing at the starting line, get moving—you can do it.
