## My Journey

During my time in the military, I developed strong problem-solving skills and learned the value of systematic approaches to complex challenges. These skills translate directly to software development, where breaking down problems and building solutions incrementally is key.

## Current Focus

I'm currently building **VetConnect**, a comprehensive Veterans Resource Hub that helps veterans find and access essential services. This project combines my personal experience with my new technical skills to create something that makes a real difference.

## Technical Skills

**Frontend Development**

- React & TypeScript
- Next.js & Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design & accessibility

**Backend Development**

- Java & Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL & database design
- REST API development

**Tools & Practices**

- Git & GitHub
- Testing (Jest, JUnit)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monorepo architecture (Turborepo)

## What I'm Learning

I'm constantly expanding my skills through hands-on projects and contributing to open source. Right now, I'm focused on:

- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- Modern DevOps practices
- System design and architecture

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to opportunities, collaborations, and conversations about technology and how it can serve our communities better. Feel free to [reach out](/contact)!
