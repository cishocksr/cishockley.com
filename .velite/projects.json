With an outdated design and limited content management capabilities, they needed a modern platform that would inspire volunteers and nonprofits alike while being maintainable by non-technical staff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-mission\">The Mission</h2>\n<p>Cleveland GiveCamp brings together developers, designers, and project managers for a 48-hour hackathon to build technology solutions for local nonprofits—completely free of charge. Over 15 years, they've helped 250+ nonprofits and contributed over $7.2 million in value to the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-approach\">Our Approach</h2>\n<p>Working with a team of six volunteers, we redesigned and rebuilt their entire web presence over a single weekend. We chose Squarespace as our foundation to balance rapid development with long-term maintainability, then enhanced it with custom HTML/CSS components for unique features like the sponsor carousel.</p>\n<p>The result is a modern, mobile-responsive website that effectively communicates their mission, celebrates their impact, and makes it easy for both volunteers and nonprofits to get involved.</p>",

Color-coded cells show visited nodes, the current frontier, and the final path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-animation-challenge\">The Animation Challenge</h3>\n<p>The biggest technical hurdle was rendering hundreds of state changes smoothly. My initial implementation updated the UI immediately after each algorithm step, which caused severe jank on slower devices.</p>\n<p>The solution was a render queue that batches updates and uses <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to synchronize with the browser's refresh rate. This achieved consistent 60fps animations while keeping the algorithm logic clean and separate from the rendering logic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design-for-learning\">Design for Learning</h3>\n<p>Color choices weren't arbitrary - I researched data visualization best practices to ensure high contrast and accessibility. The palette makes it easy to distinguish between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unexplored cells (white)</li>\n<li>Frontier cells being considered (light blue)</li>\n<li>Visited cells already explored (darker blue)</li>\n<li>The final path (yellow)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"side-by-side-comparison\">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>\n<p>The comparison mode lets users run BFS and DFS simultaneously on the same maze. This visual comparison makes the algorithms' differences immediately obvious:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BFS explores level-by-level (finds shortest path)</li>\n<li>DFS dives deep before backtracking (may not find shortest path)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seeing this play out in real-time is far more intuitive than reading about it.</p>",
