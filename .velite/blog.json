Some may say it’s been too long for a dream—that it’s nothing more than that. But technology has been part of my life since third grade, when I was lucky to learn in the <strong>Math &#x26; Science Center</strong> in the basement of the East Cleveland Public Library in East Cleveland, OH.</p>\n<p>There, we used Apple II computers—my first real glimpse of computing. I didn’t know it then, but the curiosity that started in that basement would trail me for years, waiting for me to notice.</p>\n<p>When my family finally had a home computer, I wanted to write scripts and build things. Then life kept moving, and I started to believe this was something I could never truly achieve. It became a childhood dream I quietly tucked away.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fast-forward to adulthood: I joined the <strong>U.S. Navy</strong>. While serving, I went deeper—binary concepts, advanced networking, the foundations behind the screens. But, as before, <em>life was lifing</em>, and a path into tech still didn’t feel clear.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>During the pandemic I picked up JavaScript. I began to understand programming fundamentals and realized I’d been standing behind my own barrier to entry. Then I found community at <strong>Lambda School</strong>, where I learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and some backend with Node.js.</p>\n<p>I thought it would lead straight to a tech job. It didn’t—but that wasn’t on the program. Many in my cohort (and alumni before us) landed great roles and are doing amazing work.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>My story was different. Maybe because I was a single dad focused on providing. Maybe because I didn’t yet believe I belonged. Either way, I kept my day job and kept honing my skills—telling myself I’d keep going <em>until I got better</em>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I went to work at <strong>Amazon</strong>, moved into leadership, and the money was good. But the stability became an anchor—steady and heavy—keeping me in a familiar, comfortable place when I knew there was more to explore.</p>\n<p>The itch never stopped tugging. Through Amazon, I was accepted into a <strong>Java Developer Bootcamp</strong> run by <strong>Tech Elevator</strong>. We revisited HTML/CSS and went deep into <strong>Java</strong>, a backbone language for backend systems.</p>\n<p>It was tough: I worked 45–60 hours a week, then sat through a five-hour class after a 12-hour shift. But I showed up. I learned. I grew.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now I’m putting myself out there. I built this portfolio and a blog I’ll update at least twice a month—not just to show my technical growth, but my growth as a person.</p>\n<p>So, welcome. Browse the projects, read the posts, and leave a note in the guestbook. This site is here to showcase my work, yes—but more than that, it’s here to show the <strong>power of perseverance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Today, I’m not yet a working developer… but I will be soon. And that third-grader who once played on those Apple II computers will get to see where his curiosity led.</p>\n<p>If you’re standing at the starting line, get moving—you can do it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.”</em><br>\n— <strong>Rumi</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",

This year, the event supported 10 different nonprofit organizations, including GiveCamp itself.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"history-of-cleveland-givecamp\">History of Cleveland GiveCamp</h2>\n<p>Now in its 15th year, 2025 marked the first time Cleveland GiveCamp was officially recognized as a nonprofit by the IRS. Over the past decade and a half, they’ve helped more than 250 nonprofits, engaged over 1,000 volunteers, and contributed over $7.2 million in value.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-joined\">Why I Joined</h2>\n<p>As someone new to the field of software development, this was my first opportunity to contribute to a real-world project outside of an academic setting. I got to work side-by-side with developers, project managers, and designers — and learn from all of them.</p>\n<p>Being able to work with professional developers helped my confidence. I don’t subscribe to the idea of <em>imposter syndrome</em>, but I have felt that I might not be ready to be a working developer. This opportunity gave me the space to find out if I was truly ready to be a paid developer in the “wild.”</p>\n<p>Beyond professional growth, this event spoke to something deeper. Service is core to who I am. Being able to apply the knowledge I’ve gained to help organizations whose entire mission is to uplift others — especially those society too often overlooks — was truly fulfilling.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-project\">The Project</h2>\n<p><cover src=\"/images/blog/TeamGiveCamp.jpeg\" alt=\"Cleveland GiveCamp 2025 Team at Work\"></cover></p>\n<p>Our team was paired with the nonprofit <strong>Cleveland GiveCamp Inc.</strong>, whose mission is to connect tech professionals with nonprofits that need software solutions. Their request was straightforward but impactful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Redesign their outdated website to better reflect their mission and community impact.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"my-role\">My Role</h3>\n<p>I contributed as both a developer and a designer. My responsibilities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designed and built the <strong>Events</strong> section</li>\n<li>Assisted with the overall layout and visual design</li>\n<li>Developed a scrolling tag of sponsor logos to showcase community partners</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"tools--technologies\">Tools &#x26; Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Squarespace</strong> – Chosen so the organization can easily update content without developer assistance</li>\n<li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> – Used to create the smooth scrolling sponsor section</li>\n<li><strong>Taiga (Kanban)</strong> – Project management tool to organize our tasks and sprints</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-weekend-workflow\">The Weekend Workflow</h2>\n<p>GiveCamp is fast-paced — you have just 48 hours to deliver a working solution. Here’s how our weekend unfolded:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Friday</strong>: Meet the nonprofit, understand the project scope, begin initial planning</li>\n<li><strong>Saturday</strong>: Full day of design and development — powered by caffeine and collaboration</li>\n<li><strong>Sunday</strong>: Polish, debug, present the final product, and hand off documentation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The best part? Everyone was there for the same reason: to help. You’re surrounded by people who bring positive energy, problem-solving skills, and a deep sense of purpose.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constraints fuel creativity.</strong> With limited time, we had to prioritize and make smart decisions fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Mission matters.</strong> Hearing directly from the nonprofit grounded our work in real impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Community is powerful.</strong> Watching strangers become a high-performing team in a weekend was incredible.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Cleveland GiveCamp reminded me that software isn’t just about clean code or elegant UI — it’s about people, purpose, and meaningful outcomes.</p>\n<p>Changing careers often comes with practical goals — better pay, better hours, and a fresh challenge. But GiveCamp showed me something deeper: the skills I’ve gained can have a direct, positive impact on people’s lives. In a world connected by the internet, where data is the new currency, this experience reminded me that technology can be a force for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to Get Involved?</h3>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://clevelandgivecamp.org\">clevelandgivecamp.org</a> or check if your city hosts a similar event.<br>\nBring your skills. Leave with purpose.</p>",

Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 + MDX for writing, Supabase for auth/guestbook, Framer Motion for subtle flourishes. I broke a few things; I fixed them; I wrote down the fixes so Future Me doesn’t repeat them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They say your portfolio is your developer résumé. Mine’s also my workbench. I’ve chased “perfect” before; this time I shipped something simple that helps me show work, publish what I learn, and keep growing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"tech-stack\">Tech Stack</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Next.js 15</strong> — React, RSC, and a batteries-included DX for a full-stack site.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailwind CSS v4</strong> — Utility-first styling with zero-runtime, smaller builds, and design tokens that keep me honest.</li>\n<li><strong>MDX</strong> — Markdown first, React when I need it. Each post exports a typed <code>metadata</code> object.</li>\n<li><strong>Framer Motion</strong> — Small, focused primitives for “you notice it later” motion.</li>\n<li><strong>Supabase</strong> — OAuth (GitHub/Google), Postgres, and RLS for a friendly, safe guestbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"starting-without-starting-from-scratch\">Starting without starting from scratch</h2>\n<p>I kept it minimal, then borrowed thoughtfully. Shout-outs to <strong>@ibelick</strong> for Motion Primitives inspiration, as well as basic design and <strong>@leerob</strong> for the guestbook spark. Tiny touches > loud UI.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"making-the-ui-feel-alive-without-shouting\">Making the UI feel alive (without shouting)</h2>\n<p>I like motion you <em>notice later</em>: a sliding highlight under nav items, a magnetic nudge on icons, a word morphing in the hero. I built single-purpose parts — <code>AnimatedBackground</code>, <code>Magnetic</code>, <code>TextEffect</code> — and set them to about 7/10.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note to self: <em>motion should point, not peacock.</em> If it doesn’t help someone understand where to look next, it’s probably too much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> is on, the site steps aside. Accessibility isn’t a toggle; it’s a tone.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"a-writing-flow-ill-actually-use\">A writing flow I’ll actually use</h2>\n<p>I draft in <strong>Obsidian</strong>, then drop a file into <code>content/posts/*.mdx</code>. Each post exports <code>metadata</code> that’s validated with <strong>Zod</strong>. The blog index reads those, calculates reading time, sorts by <code>updated</code> when present, and hides drafts. Just enough structure to publish without friction.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-guestbook-small-feature-real-constraints\">The guestbook (small feature, real constraints)</h2>\n<p>I wanted a friendly way to say hi. <strong>Supabase</strong> gives me OAuth, a Postgres table, and <strong>RLS</strong>. The UI is simple: one <code>AuthButton</code>, one <code>GuestbookClient</code>, and a list of entries. There’s a modest admin layer for visibility/flags and soft delete.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"a-short-list-of-things-i-broke-and-how-i-fixed-them\">A short list of things I broke (and how I fixed them)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>OAuth redirect purgatory.</strong> I forgot to register both<br>\n<code>http://localhost:3000/auth/callback</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>https://www.cishockley.com/auth/callback</code>.<br>\n<strong>Fix:</strong> register both; build <code>redirectTo</code> from <code>new URL('/auth/callback', origin)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Images blocked by <code>next/image</code>.</strong> Google avatars (<code>lh3.googleusercontent.com</code>) weren’t whitelisted.<br>\n<strong>Fix:</strong> add a <code>remotePatterns</code> entry in <code>next.config</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<details>\n  <summary>Show <code>next.config.mjs</code> change</summary>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// next.config.mjs\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'lh3.googleusercontent.com' },\n      { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'avatars.githubusercontent.com' },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n</code></pre>\n</details>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Underline everywhere.</strong> Blog titles were always underlined.<br>\n<strong>Fix:</strong> move to <code>hover:underline</code> and keep the base clean.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Framer Motion “but the option exists…”.</strong> I passed an undocumented prop to <code>useScroll</code>.

This guide covers everything you need to know about modern web development practices, from frontend frameworks to backend architectures.</p>\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frontend-development\">Frontend Development</h2>\n<p>The frontend landscape has changed significantly with the introduction of modern frameworks and libraries. Let's explore the key concepts and tools that define modern frontend development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"react-and-modern-frameworks\">React and Modern Frameworks</h3>\n<p>React has revolutionized how we build user interfaces. Its component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI elements that maintain their own state and compose together to form complex applications.</p>\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent vel nisi vitae eros tincidunt consectetur. Nullam euismod, nisl eget ultricies aliquam, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, vitae aliquam nisl nunc vitae nisl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"state-management\">State Management</h3>\n<p>Managing state in large applications requires careful consideration. Modern solutions include Context API, Redux, Zustand, and Jotai, each with their own strengths and use cases.</p>\n<p>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>\n<h3 id=\"css-and-styling\">CSS and Styling</h3>\n<p>Modern CSS has become incredibly powerful with features like Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables. Tailwind CSS has also emerged as a popular utility-first framework.</p>\n<h4 id=\"css-in-js-solutions\">CSS-in-JS Solutions</h4>\n<p>Styled-components and Emotion provide ways to write CSS directly in your JavaScript files, offering dynamic styling based on props and state.</p>\n<h4 id=\"utility-first-frameworks\">Utility-First Frameworks</h4>\n<p>Tailwind CSS takes a different approach, providing low-level utility classes that you compose to build custom designs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backend-architecture\">Backend Architecture</h2>\n<p>Backend development involves designing systems that are scalable, maintainable, and secure. Let's explore modern backend architectures and patterns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restful-apis\">RESTful APIs</h3>\n<p>REST remains the most common architectural style for building web APIs. It uses standard HTTP methods and status codes to create predictable interfaces.</p>\n<p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"graphql\">GraphQL</h3>\n<p>GraphQL offers a more flexible alternative to REST, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single query.</p>\n<p>At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati.</p>\n<h3 id=\"database-design\">Database Design</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right database is crucial for your application's performance and scalability. Options include relational databases like PostgreSQL, document stores like MongoDB, and graph databases like Neo4j.</p>\n<h2 id=\"devops-and-deployment\">DevOps and Deployment</h2>\n<p>Modern web development requires understanding deployment pipelines, containerization, and cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"continuous-integration\">Continuous Integration</h3>\n<p>CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and reducing manual errors. Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins are commonly used.</p>\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>\n<h3 id=\"docker-and-containerization\">Docker and Containerization</h3>\n<p>Docker allows you to package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.</p>\n<p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-platforms\">Cloud Platforms</h3>\n<p>AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure provide scalable infrastructure for deploying web applications. Understanding these platforms is essential for modern developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-optimization\">Performance Optimization</h2>\n<p>Performance is critical for user experience and SEO. Let's explore key optimization techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"frontend-performance\">Frontend Performance</h3>\n<p>Optimizing bundle sizes, lazy loading, and code splitting can dramatically improve load times. Tools like Lighthouse help identify performance bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-performance\">Backend Performance</h3>\n<p>Database query optimization, caching strategies, and efficient API design are crucial for backend performance.</p>\n<p>Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security-best-practices\">Security Best Practices</h2>\n<p>Security should be a priority throughout the development process, not an afterthought.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authentication-and-authorization\">Authentication and Authorization</h3>\n<p>Implementing secure authentication using OAuth, JWT tokens, and proper session management protects user data and application resources.</p>\n<p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-protection\">Data Protection</h3>\n<p>Encrypting sensitive data, using HTTPS, and following OWASP guidelines helps protect against common vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-strategies\">Testing Strategies</h2>\n<p>Comprehensive testing ensures code quality and prevents regressions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-testing\">Unit Testing</h3>\n<p>Unit tests verify individual functions and components work correctly in isolation. Jest and Vitest are popular testing frameworks.</p>\n<p>Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing\">Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work together correctly. Tools like Cypress and Playwright enable end-to-end testing.</p>\n<p>Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Modern web development requires mastering a wide range of technologies and practices. By understanding these concepts and continuously learning, you can build robust, scalable web applications.</p>\n<p>The field continues to evolve, so staying current with new tools and best practices is essential for success in web development.</p>",
